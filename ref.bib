  abstract = {Observational research promises to complement experimental research by providing large, diverse populations that would be infeasible for an experiment. Observational research can test its own clinical hypotheses, and observational studies also can contribute to the design of experiments and inform the generalizability of experimental research. Understanding the diversity of populations and the variance in care is one component. In this study, the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) collaboration created an international data network with 11 data sources from four countries, including electronic health records and administrative claims data on 250 million patients. All data were mapped to common data standards, patient privacy was maintained by using a distributed model, and results were aggregated centrally. Treatment pathways were elucidated for type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and depression. The pathways revealed that the world is moving toward more consistent therapy over time across diseases and across locations, but significant heterogeneity remains among sources, pointing to challenges in generalizing clinical trial results. Diabetes favored a single first-line medication, metformin, to a much greater extent than hypertension or depression. About 10\% of diabetes and depression patients and almost 25\% of hypertension patients followed a treatment pathway that was unique within the cohort. Aside from factors such as sample size and underlying population (academic medical center versus general population), electronic health records data and administrative claims data revealed similar results. Large-scale international observational research is feasible.},

  abstract = {This talk explores the use of Julia in a novel observational health research study that explores health equity and mental health in \textasciitilde 100 million patients in an international collaborative effort across more than 4 countries. Contributions and efforts within the JuliaHealth and adjacent communities have made working with this data possible. The approaches and results shared will be valuable for potential researchers and will open new frontiers for high performance computing and health analytics. Conducting health research studies at scale to understand the health of specific communities and subpopulations has long been a struggle. This has been due to a variety of issues, such as a lack of international standards in the structure of electronic health records, patient claims data, and diagnoses. Moreover, the investigation of questions related to the topic of health equity (that is, the skewed distribution of health resources or services to various subpopulations seeking healthcare) has been largely stalled due to these problems. In a previous talk I gave, Using Julia for Observational Health Research, I presented early work on the success of using Julia within the space of observational health research in utilizing the OMOP Common Data Model. In that previous work, I conducted a pilot study to characterize prevalence rates in mental health care for intersectional subpopulations suffering from bipolar disorder, depression, and/or suicidality. This work utilized novel tooling and approaches created within Julia to successfully analyze data from \textasciitilde 2.5 million Medicaid subscribers within the U.S. state of Georgia. This work earned the highest awards at the top observational health research venue, drove another successful grant proposal, and resulted in multiple invited talks. Buoyed by the interest and success of this pilot work, my team and I have moved this project into the next phase: the examination of more than 100 million patients from more than 4 countries across the globe. In this talk, I will present advances within the JuliaHealth community and the broader Julia ecosystem that have made possible such large scale and federated analyses. In particular, novel JuliaHealth tools such as OMOPCDMCohortCreator.jl will be highlighted to show how to analyze "big" real world data, how using Julia can be of huge benefit within this space, and how Julia community members could start using these tools for their own research. As this study now takes place across multiple countries, time will also be spent discussing how Julia lends itself very well to robust analyses using literate programming tools such as Quarto or Weave.jl and versioning processes through DrWatson.jl or Data Version Control, which can be utilized to handle each country's specific needs. Additionally, I will spend some time discussing issues encountered (both technical and anthropological), ways that the Julia ecosystem could potentially grow to support future work in this research domain, and opportunities for Julia users to get involved. Finally, I will share my personal thoughts on what open questions there are to be addressed in observational health research and how Julia can be a tool to address public health questions and provide insight into questions of health disparities. In conclusion, this talk will highlight the real world use of Julia in large-scale health research studies built on real world data. Moreover, it will show the potential of the various ecosystems within Julia to analyze and tackle complex questions within health equity. Through this talk, I invite future Julia users and researchers to join me in pursuing the potential of Julia within the space of observational health research.}

  abstract = {Health informatics can inform decisions that practitioners, patients, policymakers, and researchers need to make about health and disease. Health informatics is built upon patient health data leading to the need to codify patient health information. Such standardization is required to compute population statistics (such as prevalence, incidence, etc.) that are common metrics used in fields such as epidemiology. Reliable decision-making about health and disease rests on our ability to organize, analyze, and assess data repositories that contain patient health data. While standards exist to structure and analyze patient data across patient data sources such as health information exchanges, clinical data repositories, and health data marketplaces, analogous best practices for rigorously defining patient populations in health informatics contexts do not exist. Codifying best practices for developing disease definitions could support the effective development of clinical guidelines, inform algorithms used in clinical decision support systems, and additional patient guidelines. In this paper, we present a workflow for the development of phenotype definitions. This workflow presents a series of recommendations for defining health and disease. Various examples within this paper are presented to demonstrate this workflow in health informatics contexts.},
